There's can be n/0, -- or ++, == and others errors
There's can be no =

Degree 0:
4*x^0-4*x^0 - any number is answer
4*x^0-8*x^0 - there's no solution


Degree 1:
Always have solution
1*x^0+7*x^1
x = -1/7 (float type)


Degree 2:
Reduced form: c*x^0 +/- b*x^1 +/- a*x^2 = 0
D (Discriminant) = b^2 - 4*a*c

D > 0
There's two solution
Formula: x = (-b +/- sqrt(D)) / 2*a

D = 0
There's one solution
Formula: x = -b / 2*a

D < 0
There's two solution
Formula: x = (-b +/- i*sqrt(4*a*c - b^2)) / 2*a
